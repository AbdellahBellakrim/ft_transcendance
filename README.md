Learn the basics of web development: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Choose a backend framework that suits your preferences and has good WebSocket support, such as Node.js with Express.js or Django with Channels.

Set up a basic backend server using your chosen framework.

Learn about WebSockets and their implementation in your selected backend framework.

Implement a WebSocket server in your backend to handle client connections, messages, and room/channel management.

Set up a PostgreSQL database to store chat messages and user data.

Integrate the backend WebSocket server with the PostgreSQL database for data storage.

Choose a frontend framework or library that suits your preferences and has good WebSocket support, such as React with libraries like Socket.IO or SockJS.

Set up a basic frontend application using your chosen framework.

Implement a WebSocket client in your frontend to establish a connection with the backend WebSocket server.

Design and implement UI components for displaying chat messages, user lists, input fields, etc.

Implement sending and receiving chat messages in real-time using the WebSocket connection.

Enhance the chat experience by implementing features like channel/room creation, joining, and leaving.

Implement user-to-user direct messaging functionality.

Add basic security measures, such as server-side validation of input and protection against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

Test the chat functionality thoroughly, including real-time updates, messaging between multiple users, and handling edge cases.

Deploy the chat application to a suitable environment, considering the project requirements for Docker and Linux compatibility.

Working on the chat part of the project can provide you with valuable learning opportunities in several areas. Here are some key aspects you can learn from working on the chat functionality:

Real-time Communication: Implementing a chat system involves working with real-time communication protocols like websockets. You'll learn how to establish bidirectional communication channels between the server and clients, allowing for instant messaging and updates.

Event-Driven Architecture: Chat systems often follow an event-driven architecture, where events (such as new messages or user actions) trigger specific actions or updates. You'll gain experience in designing and implementing event-driven systems, handling events, and broadcasting messages to relevant users or chat channels.

User Interactions and Privacy: Chat systems involve various user interactions, such as creating channels, sending direct messages, and managing user blocks. You'll learn how to handle these interactions, enforce privacy rules, and ensure that messages are delivered securely and accurately to the intended recipients.

Channel Management: Building a chat system typically includes features like creating public or private channels, setting passwords for protected channels, and assigning channel ownership. You'll learn how to handle channel management functionalities, such as creating, updating, and deleting channels, as well as assigning permissions and managing channel administrators.

User Profiles and Interaction: Chat systems often provide features for users to view and interact with each other's profiles. You'll learn how to implement profile views, handle friend requests, display user statuses (online, offline, in a game, etc.), and enable interactions like inviting users to play games or initiating direct messages.

Security and Moderation: Chat systems require considerations for security and moderation. You'll learn how to handle user blocking, implement spam detection, and enforce content moderation policies to maintain a safe and respectful chat environment.

Throughout the chat implementation, you'll also gain experience in backend development, database integration (such as storing chat messages and user information), and frontend development for displaying chat interfaces and handling user interactions.

Overall, working on the chat part will provide you with insights into real-time communication, event-driven architecture, user interactions, privacy considerations, and security aspects of building interactive chat systems.
